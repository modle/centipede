- DONE set up canvas

- DONE set up gamePiece boundary
  - what happens when game piece reaches boundary?
    - Just stop adding to that direction.
    - Look at how human movement is handled at the edge of the screen in Robotron

- DONE add bullet shooting upward only (space? no, shift)

- DONE use same score/level/timer/lives counters as robotron
  - DONE extract those elements out into a separate js file

- single-unit centipede to figure out direction reversing
  - down one 'row' (screen height/20) unless bottom, then up
    - if going up, only go up to limit of gamePiece boundary
  - reverse direction

- how to chain centipedes?
    - could give them IDs and treat them like a linked list, each one behind following the one in front

- player collision: centipede hitting player resets all monsters on the screen and spawns a new centipede
  - mushroom resetting? or does that happen when centipede dies? or x number of centipedes die?

- shooting centipedes
  - if centipede movement handling is done correctly, breaking the centipede by shooting it should be handled automatically

- destroying centipede ends level
  - all 'mushrooms' revert back to original color and player gets bonus points
    - does it? see player collision above
