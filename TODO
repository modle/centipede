- set up canvas
- set up gamePiece boundary
  - what happens when game piece reaches boundary?
    - Just stop adding to that direction.
    - Look at how human movement is handled at the edge of the screen in Robotron
- add bullet shooting upward only (space?)
- random mushroom placement
  - number of mushrooms random between 2 numbers
- single-unit centipede to figure out direction reversing
  - down one 'row' (screen height/20) unless bottom, then up
    - if going up, only go up to limit of gamePiece boundary
  - reverse direction
- how to chain centipedes?
  - could give them IDs and treat them like a linked list, each one behind following the one in front
- 'mushrooms' change color when you shoot them for 3-4 different colors, then disappear
- shooting centipedes
  - if centipede movement handling is done correctly, breaking the centipede by shooting it should be handled automatically
- annoying jumpy spider
- the worm that moves across the top
- centipede or spider hitting player resets all monsters on the screen and spawns a new centipede
- destroying centipede ends level
  - all 'mushrooms' revert back to original color and player gets bonus points
- use same score/level/timer/lives counters as robotron
  - DONE extract those elements out into a separate js file
